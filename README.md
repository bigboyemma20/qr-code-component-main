## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties(variables)
- Flexbox layout
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Google fonts - Outfit


### What I learned

This project has helped me in  understanding of best practices in HTML structure and using CSS custom properties. I also got some valuable skills, like centering elements on the page with Flexbox and applying spacing through padding, border-radius, and letter-spacing.

css sample
```css
body{
    
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column; 
    align-items: center;  
    justify-content: center;
    background-color: var(--Slate300);   
    text-align: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
}


.card {
    width: 320px;
    overflow: hidden;
    background-color: var(--White);
    border-radius: 20px;
    padding: 16px 16px 40px 16px;
}


### Continued development

I will continue to explore more projects to enhance my skills in flex layouts and also improve on my css knowledge.
